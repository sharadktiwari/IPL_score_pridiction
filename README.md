# IPL_score_pridiction
I worked on a web app using Flask. Give Inputs as (batting_team, bowling_team, overs, runs, wickets, runs_in_prev_5_overs, wickets_in_prev_5_overs) and it will predict the approximate score the batting team may score within 20 overs. 

# Dataset:
ipl.csv

# Classifier:
1. Ridge Regressor (With Hyperparameter tuning)
   * You can use any regressor you want to use.

# Pre-Requisits:
Must have Python3, Flask.Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

# Instructions to run:
1. First clone the project
2. Open Jupyter and Run your 'Cricket_score_prediction' file.
3. Then in anaconda prompt goto the working directory and run command 'set FLASK_APP=ipl_score.py' then run 'set FLASK_DEBUG=1' noe finally run 'flask run'.
4. Now fill all the required options and submit to get the predicted Score.
